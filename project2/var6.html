<h3>I Made Myself a Snowball</h3>
I made myself <strong> a </strong> snowball, as <strong> perfect </strong> as could be. I <strong> thought </strong> I&#8217d keep it as a pet, and <strong> let it sleep </strong> with me. I made it some pajamas And <strong> a </strong> pillow for its head. Then <strong> last night </strong> it ran away, But first it wet the bed!
