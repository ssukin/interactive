<strong>I Made Myself a Snowball</strong>
&#8212 Shel Silverstein, <i> Falling Up </i><br><br><br>
I made myself a snowball,
as perfect as could be.
I thought I&#8217d keep it as a pet,
and let it<li><i>sleep </i></li><br>with me.
I made it some <br><br><li><i>pajamas</i></li><br><br>
And a <br><br><li><i>pillow</i> </li><br><br>for its head.
Then last night it ran away,
But first it wet the <br><br><li><i>bed!</i></li><br><br>
