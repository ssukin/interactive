I Made Myself a Snowball<br><br>
<br> <br> I made myself a snowball,
<br> <br> as perfect as could be. 
<br> <br> I thought I&#8217d keep it as a pet,
<br> <br> and let it sleep with me.
<br> <br> I made it some pajamas
<br> <br> And a pillow for its head.
<br> <br> Then last night it ran away,
<br> <br> But first it wet the bed!<br> <br>
