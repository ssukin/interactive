		  <p> what did you want to be when you grew up? </p>
			 <p> i was pre-med in undergraduate looking to make a career out of medical research. i took an art 101 course to fulfill my humanities credit and it blew my mind. it ended up redirecting me towards photography, design and the visual arts. </p>

			<div class="test">
		  <p> what was the artistic environment at cranbrook like? </p>
			 <p> for me, cranbrook was creative heaven and i would not have traded the experience for anything--beautiful saarinen buildings and campus, small student body, challenging and engaged department peers, and supportive department leaders in kathy and michael mccoy. it was all the best. since itâ€™s only a grad program, being able to focus on work was my primary agenda. two years is the normal tenure but i loved it so much that i requested a third year and was granted permission to stay there.</p>

			<div class="test">
			<p> what was the most important piece of work you developed or concept you learned during your year in the Netherlands with the Fulbright grant? </p>
			<p> the willingness to embrace and capitalize on deprivation <br>
				in holland, although everyone speaks english, understanding dutch is still essential to gain a glimpse of dutch culture.
				i lacked the language skills and consequently turned my focus to pure form, which allowed me to feel conversant in the visual sense.	</p>
